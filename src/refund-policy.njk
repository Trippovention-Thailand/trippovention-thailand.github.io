        <h2>1. General Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Refunds are subject to the terms and conditions of individual bookings and service providers. Cancellation charges may apply depending on the timing and type of service.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-40">2. Tour Package Cancellations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>30+ days before departure:</strong> Full refund minus processing fees</li>

        <h2 class="mt-40">3. Visa Services</h2>
        <p>Visa service fees are non-refundable once the application process has begun. Embassy fees may be partially refundable depending on the stage of processing.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-40">4. Flight Bookings</h2>
        <p>Flight cancellation and refund policies are governed by the airline's terms and conditions. We will assist you in processing refund requests but cannot guarantee refund amounts.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-40">5. Hotel Bookings</h2>
        <p>Hotel cancellation policies vary by property and room type. Non-refundable rates offer lower prices but no refund upon cancellation.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-40">6. Refund Processing</h2>
        <p>Approved refunds will be processed within 7-14 business days. The refund will be credited to the original payment method used for the booking.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-40">7. Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>In cases of force majeure (natural disasters, pandemics, political unrest, etc.), we will work with you to reschedule or provide credit for future travel.</p>
